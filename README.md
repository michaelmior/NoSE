This is a work in progress tool to provide automated physical schema design for NoSQL data stores.
NoSE is licensed under the [GPLv3 license](LICENSE.md).

## Getting Started

If you want to quickly try NoSE, you can get a shell with all necessary dependencies using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as follows

    docker run --interactive --tty --rm michaelmior/nose /bin/bash

For continued use, installing a development version of the NoSE CLI is more flexible.
Instructions can be found in the [nose-cli](https://github.com/michaelmior/nose-cli) repository.
